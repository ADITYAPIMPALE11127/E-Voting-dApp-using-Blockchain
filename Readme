# E-Voting System Smart Contract

## Overview

This repository contains a Solidity smart contract for an E-Voting System. The smart contract facilitates candidate registration, voter eligibility, vote casting, and result tracking. It ensures the integrity of the voting process and is designed to operate without a frontend user interface.

## Features

- Candidate registration.
- Voter registration with Ethereum addresses.
- Secure vote casting and tracking.
- Prevention of double voting.
- Transparent result monitoring.

## How to Use

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure that you have a development environment set up with Remix or another Solidity IDE. You may also need a testnet or local blockchain for testing.

2. **Compile and Deploy**: Use your Solidity IDE to compile and deploy the smart contract to your chosen blockchain network. Note the contract address.

3. **Register Candidates**: Using the deployed contract, register candidates by calling the `addCandidate` function. Provide a unique candidate ID and name.

4. **Register Voters**: Register eligible voters by calling the `registerVoter` function. Use the voter's Ethereum address as the parameter.

5. **Cast Votes**: Voters can cast their votes by calling the `vote` function, providing the candidate ID as the parameter.

6. **View Results**: To check the vote count for specific candidates, call the `getVoteCountForCandidate` function with the candidate's ID as the parameter.

7. **Security**: Ensure the security of private keys and adhere to best practices for interacting with the smart contract.

## Testing

Test the smart contract thoroughly on a testnet or local blockchain to confirm its functionality and security.
